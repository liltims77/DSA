# 92. Reverse Linked List II

# Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where left <= right, 
# reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position right, and return the reversed list.

 

# Example 1:
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
# Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

# Example 2:
# Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
# Output: [5]


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        dummy = ListNode(0, head)

        # 1. reach node at position "left"
        leftPrev, curr = dummy, head
        for i in range(left - 1):
            leftPrev, curr = curr, curr.next


        # Now curr="left", leftPrev="node before left"
        # 2. reverse from left to right
        prev = None
        for i in range(right - left + 1):
            tmpNext = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev, curr = curr, tmpNext


        # 3. Update pointers
        leftPrev.next.next = curr # curr is node after "right"
        leftPrev.next = prev # prev is "right"
        return dummy.next
